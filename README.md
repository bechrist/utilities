# utilities
This repo is a collection of programming utilities that have proven relevant across multiple of my projects. Heavily inspired by my collaborator Nick Alger's [helper function library](https://github.com/NickAlger/nalger_helper_functions). See also:
- [yaml_prop](https://github.com/bechrist/yaml_prop): PyYAML extension for physical properties
- [suspension_designer/geometry.py](https://github.com/bechrist/suspension_designer/blob/main/suspension_designer/geometry.py): 3D geometry utilities
